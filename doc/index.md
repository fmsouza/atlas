About
=====

__Marvie__ is the PHP Framework focused in help you to write code doing what Object-Orientation has to offer you.

It was born from the necessity of transfer code between PHP frameworks, which can't be accomplished in most Frameworks out there. Firstly it was just a simple MVC Framework where you could simple create your classes and freely define your lifecycle as you wish. But it grew up and became a platform to write Object-Oriented code with the help of every PHP resource.

Features
--------

* Autoload classes
* Freedom to define logic
* Annotations
* Unit tests
* Easy RESTful implementation
* HTML manipulation


Requirements
------------

* Webserver (Apache, IIS, ...)
* PHP 5.3+


Installation
------------

Just [download](download.md) the source code in your computer and place in the Apache or IIS server with an active PHP installation and it should be ready to go.

Then you can just access it by typing it's path in the server address in the browser, like
