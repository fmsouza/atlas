Marvie
======

It's a PHP MVC Framework with a simple philosofy: everything you write here can be easily ported to every other Framework without losses.

While you lose lot of time doing re-job with migration between other Frameworks, you don't have this issue with Marvie.

To write a class in Marvie, you don't have any dependencies like extend or implement other parent classes. You'll just write your class and use it.
